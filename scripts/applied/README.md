# Applied Scripts

This directory contains scripts that have already been applied to the codebase and are kept for reference purposes.

## Scripts

### UI Update Scripts

- **update-icons.sh**: Updated all IoDiamond icons to FaRobot icons throughout the application
- **update-sidebar-color.sh**: Updated sidebar/left panel backgrounds to use #1A1E23 color
- **update-content-panels.sh**: Updated right-side content panels to use #1A1E23 color

## Purpose

These scripts are archived here after being successfully applied to the codebase. They serve as documentation of the changes made and can be referenced if similar updates are needed in the future.

## Note

If you need to apply similar changes in the future, consider creating a new script in the parent directory rather than re-running these archived scripts.
